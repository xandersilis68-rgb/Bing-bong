“Make me a GitHub Pages website with TWO playable modes:


---

Mode 1 — Smash or Pass

A classic smash-or-pass system that:

shows one item at a time

lets me press Smash or Pass

tracks all choices

works with any number of items

uses names only if no images are provided

uses images if I upload them

stores item data in a JSON file I can edit

End-screen stats must include:

smash % and pass % per item

total items reviewed

ranked list from most smashed to least

optional rating average

graphs/charts

exportable results as JSON


---

Mode 2 — Multi-Category Rating Game

A second option where I go item-by-item and rate each one in 5 categories:

1. Appearance


2. Personality


3. Buns


4. Cherrys


5. Happy



Requirements:

Each category uses a 1–10 slider

Shows one item at a time

Saves every rating

Generates a final stats page with:

averages for every category

total score per item

ranking from highest total to lowest

bar charts or radar charts for visibility

exportable results JSON


---

General Requirements

100% front-end only (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) so it runs on GitHub Pages

Responsive, modern, mobile-friendly UI

A JSON file for items (names + optional image URLs)

Ability to swap out the JSON file to update the roster

Provide full working code:

index.html

style.css

script.js

example data.json with 10 sample items

Make sure the site loads, switches between the two modes, and displays final results cleanly.”
